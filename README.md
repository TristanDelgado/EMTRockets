## Purpose
This project demonstrates the systematic application of classical software engineering methodologies
throughout the full software development life cycle (SDLC). It serves as a practical implementation 
of theoretical concepts, encompassing all phases from initial requirements engineering and user story
generation, through architectural design and modeling (including communication diagrams), to 
implementation and formal verification via structured testing procedures. 
Although the project's feature set is minimal, the primary objective is the 
rigorous application and documentation of these engineering principles.
